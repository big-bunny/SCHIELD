        Schield Center is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2008 with
        the aim of providing education to unpreviledged children in Kajiado, Kenya. The
        organization recognizes the importance of education in empowering children
        to break the cycle of poverty and improve their lives and those of their
        families. At Schield Center, we believe that every child deserves access
        to quality education, regardless of their background or financial
        situation. However, many unpreviledged children in Kajiado face significant
        barriers to education, including poverty, lack of access to schools, and
        cultural beliefs that prioritize traditional practices over formal
        education. To address these challenges, Schield Center relies on the
        generous support of sponsors who share our vision and values. With their
        help, we are able to provide scholarships, uniforms, books, and other
        school supplies to hundreds of unpreviledged children each year. We also work
        closely with local schools and communities to identify the most vulnerable
        children and provide them with the support they need to succeed. Our
        mission is to empower unpreviledged children through education, and we believe
        that with the right resources and support, they can achieve their full
        potential and contribute to the development of their communities and
        beyond. We are committed to transparency, accountability, and impact, and
        we invite you to join us in our journey to make a difference in the lives
        of unpreviledged children in Kajiado.
